## Why?
When I decided to try out Youtube Premium, I came to find there was no desktop client for Youtube Music. The website "works", however, I found it to be very sluggish and laggy. For that reason, I decided to attempt to create my own client. In the end, I have switched back to Spotify for my musical needs, so this project is no longer a priority for me.

You must have a web proxy for js/worker.js in order for the API calls to work for youtube (CORS). There is a [tracking issue](https://git.tommy-johnston.com/tommy/Rhythm/issues/1) for this project as well.
